Preparing databases for use with Proteotyping
=============================================

|name| relies on several reference databases that need to be prepared in
order to analyze a sample.

For taxonomic composition estimation, the following reference data sources are
required:

* Reference genome sequences (FASTA) 
* Reference genome annotations (GFF) 
* NCBI Taxonomy taxdump (tab separated) 

Additionally, for antibiotic resistance detection, the following reference data
sources are required:

* Antibiotic resistance gene database 
  
A prepared version of `ResFinder`_ suitable for use with |name| is available
for download `here`_.
